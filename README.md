# Villanova University Campus Touring

Noah Kramer, Joseph Madera, Maddie Wanger

The goal of this project was to create a clickable map of Villanova’s campus that highlights important locations, and when these locations are clicked the user is redirected to a page giving the user an image of the location and detailed information about it. This map will be beneficial to those touring campus, visitors, delivery people, and overall everyone unfamiliar with Villanova’s campus. 

This interactive map was implemented using Wordpress with custom PHP code to support the MySQL database that stores all of the campus locations, and the Draw Attention Wordpress plugin that allows for clickable areas on an image
